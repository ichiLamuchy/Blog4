# Blog Project

The Final Project on Get into Tech at Sky (http://getintotech.sky.com/)
May 2018

## Project Outline

As a team, create a blog website written in PHP that uses an MVC architecture. 
The website should function well on multiple different devices (desktop / tablet / phone). 
Where relevant, include JavaScript and AJAX functionality.

## Technical Specifications
Demonstrate what you have learnt throughout the program, including:

- Extensive use of the PHP language
- Strict and consistent coding standards
- The MVC architectural pattern
- Appropriate use of object-oriented programming
- Structured exception handling
- Database design skills
- The PDO library
- Use GIT / GitHub for version control
- JavaScript and AJAX

**You are not permitted to use any PHP MVC Frameworks, such as Laravel.**

## Project Specifications
Throughout this project your team should utilise Agile practices. You should assign a Scrum Master for the duration of the project and plan the number and duration of your sprints. You must conduct rituals such as stand-ups, reviews and retrospectives.
Throughout the project you will showcase your weekly progress to your instructor during your 30-minute hangout sessions. You will discuss the outcomes of your reviews and retrospectives with your instructor, including any action points identified during these rituals. Your instructor will act as both a technical advisor and the product owner.
During the last training session (week 15) you will showcase your application to your cohort and other invited guests. You should create a demonstration of your product as well as a short slide-deck detailing your teamâ€™s journey. The presentation should take 20 minutes plus extra time for audience questions.
